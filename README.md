# ICTE REPORT CODES LBU

This is an analysis report titled A Comparative Study on the Energy Consumption of Four Prominent Node.js Frameworks. The Frameworks chosen here are **Expressjs, Fastify, Nestjs, and Connect**. A thorough analysis was done to see the **energy consumption** of the frameworks when they are serving similar workloads and user bases.
Framework Selection: Expressjs, Fastify, Nest and Connect framework were selected

Database Selection: MongoDB,  a NoSQL database and stores information on the cloud.

Auditing Tool: Joulemeter is used as the energy consumption auditing too

API Testing Tool: Postman software was selected to test the API

Final Analysis: Data was stored in CSV files and final analysis is done using google Colab.

IDE : All the backend  applications were built in vs-code IDE 


This is the application Codes and screenshots and Colab codes for Data analysis. This is an academic report for the ICTE course at Leeds Beckett University.
